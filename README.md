# Nislike

NOTE: This repository is experimental

This repo's objective is to reduce the pain of nil about Ruby.

After I worked with a Rails project for about 6 months, I realized that 'The most pain point of ruby is related to nil'

When a function returns nil unexpectedly, that leads to many potential bugs.

That's the motivation of this project.
